# 📌 NUMPY MATRIX INVERSE — CHEAT SHEET

---

## 1️⃣ What is a Matrix Inverse?

* For a square matrix `A`, the **inverse** `A⁻¹` satisfies:

\[
A \cdot A^{-1} = I
\]

* Only **invertible matrices** (non-singular) have an inverse.
* **Singular matrix:** `det(A) = 0` → no inverse

---

## 2️⃣ NumPy Syntax

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Check if invertible
det = np.linalg.det(A)
if det != 0:
    A_inv = np.linalg.inv(A)
    print(A_inv)
```

* `np.linalg.inv(A)` → computes matrix inverse
* Returns **float ndarray** even for integer matrices

---

## 3️⃣ Practical Use Cases

1. **Solve Linear Systems**

```python
# Solve Ax = b
b = np.array([5, 11])
x = np.linalg.inv(A) @ b
print(x)  # [1,2]
```

* Alternative (more stable) → `np.linalg.solve(A, b)`

2. **Computer Graphics / Transformations**

* Reverse transformation:

```python
original_coords = A_inv @ transformed_coords
```

3. **Data Science / Regression**

* Linear regression (Normal equation):
  \[
  \beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y
  \]
* Use matrix inverse to compute regression coefficients

4. **Control Systems / Engineering**

* Inverse used in **state-space models** to compute control signals

---

## 4️⃣ Numerical Stability Tips

* Large or nearly singular matrices → inverse may be **unstable**
* Prefer `np.linalg.solve()` instead of computing inverse explicitly for solving systems
* Check `np.linalg.cond(A)` → condition number (large → unstable)

---

## 🔥 Quick Tips

* Only **square, non-singular matrices** have inverse
* `.T` does NOT compute inverse (transpose ≠ inverse)
* Always check `det(A) != 0` or use `np.linalg.cond(A)` for stability
