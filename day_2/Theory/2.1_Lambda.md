# 📌 PYTHON LAMBDA FUNCTIONS — COMPLETE REVISION SHEET

---

# 🧠 What is a Lambda Function?

A **lambda function** is:

> A small anonymous function written in one line.

* No name
* No `def`
* Single expression only

---

# 🔹 1️⃣ Basic Syntax

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

Example:

```python
square = lambda x: x**2
print(square(5))   # 25
```

Equivalent normal function:

```python
def square(x):
    return x**2
```

---

# 🔹 2️⃣ Anonymous Function

Lambda has **no function name**.

Used directly:

```python
print((lambda x: x+1)(5))
```

Output:

```
6
```

---

# 🔹 3️⃣ Single Expression Limitation

Lambda can only contain:

✔ One expression
❌ No multiple statements
❌ No loops
❌ No assignments
❌ No `return` keyword

Invalid:

```python
lambda x:
    y = x + 1
    return y
```

Valid:

```python
lambda x: x + 1
```

---

# 🔹 4️⃣ Use Case — Sorting

Very common in interviews.

```python
students = [("Emon", 22), ("Alex", 19), ("John", 25)]

students.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
```

Sorts by age.

---

### Sort by second letter

```python
words = ["banana", "apple", "kiwi"]

sorted(words, key=lambda x: x[1])
```

---

# 🔹 5️⃣ Use Case — `map()`

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]

squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums))
```

Equivalent list comprehension:

```python
[x**2 for x in nums]
```

---

# 🔹 6️⃣ Use Case — `filter()`

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))
```

---

# 🔹 7️⃣ Use Case — `reduce()`

```python
from functools import reduce

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, nums)
```

---

# 🔹 8️⃣ Multiple Arguments

```python
add = lambda a, b: a + b
print(add(3, 4))
```

---

# 🔹 9️⃣ Conditional Lambda

```python
check = lambda x: "Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
```

---

# 🔹 🔟 Lambda Inside Functions

```python
def multiplier(n):
    return lambda x: x * n

double = multiplier(2)
print(double(5))   # 10
```

This is a **closure**.

---

# 🔹 1️⃣1️⃣ Lambda vs Normal Function

| Lambda                 | Normal Function                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Anonymous              | Named                           |
| One expression only    | Multiple statements allowed     |
| Short and concise      | More readable for complex logic |
| Often used temporarily | Reusable                        |

---

# 🧠 When to Use Lambda

✅ Short, simple logic
✅ Sorting keys
✅ map/filter/reduce
✅ Quick transformations

---

# 🚫 When NOT to Use Lambda

❌ Complex logic
❌ Multiple steps
❌ Need documentation
❌ Reusability required

---

# ⚡ Performance Note

* No major speed difference
* It’s just syntactic sugar
* Implemented as function object internally

---

# 🎯 Common Mistakes

❌ Trying to use multiple lines
❌ Forgetting it returns automatically
❌ Overusing lambda instead of clear functions

---

# 🔥 Interview Questions (Lambda)

1. What is lambda function?
2. Why is it called anonymous?
3. What is its limitation?
4. Difference between lambda and def?
5. When would you use lambda in sorting?
6. Can lambda contain multiple statements?
7. What is a closure?
8. Is lambda faster than normal function?

---

# 🧠 Interview-Level Explanation

Internally:

* Lambda creates a function object
* Just like `def`
* But without binding to a name (unless assigned)

Example:

```python
f = lambda x: x+1
```

Is same as:

```python
def f(x):
    return x+1
```

Except lambda has no docstring and limited body.
