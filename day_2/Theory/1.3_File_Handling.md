# 📌 PYTHON FILE HANDLING — COMPLETE REVISION SHEET

---

# 🔹 1️⃣ Opening a File

```python
file = open("data.txt", "r")
```

Syntax:

```python
open(filename, mode)
```

---

# 🔹 2️⃣ File Modes

| Mode   | Meaning           |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| `"r"`  | Read (default)    |
| `"w"`  | Write (overwrite) |
| `"a"`  | Append            |
| `"rb"` | Read binary       |
| `"wb"` | Write binary      |

---

## ✅ `"r"` — Read Mode

```python
f = open("data.txt", "r")
```

* File must exist
* Error if not found

---

## ✅ `"w"` — Write Mode

```python
f = open("data.txt", "w")
```

* Creates file if not exists
* Overwrites file if exists ⚠

---

## ✅ `"a"` — Append Mode

```python
f = open("data.txt", "a")
```

* Adds content at end
* Does not erase old content

---

## ✅ `"rb"` / `"wb"` — Binary Mode

Used for:

* Images
* PDFs
* Audio
* Pickle files

Example:

```python
f = open("image.jpg", "rb")
```

---

# 🔹 3️⃣ `with` Statement (Context Manager)

Best Practice ✅

```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
```

Why use `with`?

* Automatically closes file
* Cleaner
* Safer

No need for `f.close()`

---

# 🔹 4️⃣ Reading Files

---

## ✅ `.read()`

Reads entire file as string.

```python
content = f.read()
```

You can limit size:

```python
f.read(10)   # read first 10 characters
```

---

## ✅ `.readline()`

Reads one line at a time.

```python
line = f.readline()
```

---

## ✅ `.readlines()`

Returns list of lines.

```python
lines = f.readlines()
```

Example result:

```python
['Hello\n', 'World\n']
```

---

## ✅ Best Way (Loop Through File)

```python
with open("data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())
```

Memory efficient for large files.

---

# 🔹 5️⃣ Writing Files

---

## ✅ `.write()`

```python
with open("data.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello\n")
```

Returns number of characters written.

⚠ Must manually add `\n` for new line.

---

# 🔹 6️⃣ File Pointer

File has internal cursor.

Example:

```python
with open("data.txt") as f:
    print(f.read(5))
    print(f.read(5))
```

Second read continues from where first ended.

---

## ✅ Move Pointer

```python
f.seek(0)   # go to beginning
```

Check position:

```python
f.tell()
```

---

# 🔹 7️⃣ Closing Files

Manual closing:

```python
f = open("data.txt")
f.close()
```

If not closed:

* Memory leak risk
* File lock issues

Better → use `with`.

---

# 🔹 8️⃣ Exception Handling (Basic)

Files may not exist.

---

## ❌ Problem

```python
open("missing.txt")
```

Raises:

```
FileNotFoundError
```

---

## ✅ Solution

```python
try:
    with open("missing.txt") as f:
        content = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")
```

---

## Multiple Exceptions

```python
try:
    ...
except FileNotFoundError:
    ...
except PermissionError:
    ...
```

---

## Optional `finally`

```python
try:
    f = open("data.txt")
except:
    print("Error")
finally:
    print("Done")
```

`finally` always runs.

---

# 🧠 INTERNAL WORKING (Interview Level)

When you open a file:

1. OS allocates file descriptor
2. Python wraps it in file object
3. Pointer starts at position 0
4. When closed → descriptor released

---

# 🎯 Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting to close file
❌ Using `"w"` accidentally (erases file)
❌ Forgetting `\n` in write
❌ Reading large file with `.read()` (memory heavy)

---

# 🔥 Interview Questions (File Handling)

1. What is difference between `"w"` and `"a"`?
2. Why is `with` better than manual close?
3. What is file pointer?
4. What happens if you open non-existing file in `"r"` mode?
5. Difference between `.read()` and `.readlines()`?
6. What is binary mode used for?
7. What is a context manager?
8. How does exception handling improve robustness?
