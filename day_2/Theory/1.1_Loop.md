# 📌 PYTHON `for` LOOP — COMPLETE CHEAT SHEET

---

# 🔹 1️⃣ Basic Syntax

```python
for variable in iterable:
    # code block
```

* `variable` → temporary item
* `iterable` → list, tuple, string, dict, range, etc.
* Indentation is mandatory

---

# 🔹 2️⃣ Loop Over List

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```

---

# 🔹 3️⃣ Loop Over String

```python
for char in "Python":
    print(char)
```

Each character is iterated.

---

# 🔹 4️⃣ Loop Using `range()`

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```
0 1 2 3 4
```

---

### `range(start, stop, step)`

```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```
1 3 5 7 9
```

---

# 🔹 5️⃣ Loop Over Dictionary

```python
student = {"name": "Emon", "age": 22}
```

### Keys

```python
for key in student:
    print(key)
```

### Values

```python
for value in student.values():
    print(value)
```

### Key + Value

```python
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key, value)
```

---

# 🔹 6️⃣ Loop With `enumerate()`

```python
names = ["A", "B", "C"]

for index, value in enumerate(names):
    print(index, value)
```

---

# 🔹 7️⃣ Loop With `zip()`

```python
names = ["A", "B"]
scores = [80, 90]

for name, score in zip(names, scores):
    print(name, score)
```

---

# 🔹 8️⃣ Nested Loop

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(i, j)
```

Used in:

* Matrix traversal
* Pattern printing
* Combinations

---

# 🔹 9️⃣ `break`

Stops loop immediately.

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
```

---

# 🔹 🔟 `continue`

Skips current iteration.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

---

# 🔹 1️⃣1️⃣ `pass`

Does nothing (placeholder).

```python
for i in range(5):
    pass
```

---

# 🔹 1️⃣2️⃣ `else` With For Loop (Advanced)

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished")
```

`else` runs only if loop ends normally (no break).

---

# 🔹 1️⃣3️⃣ Loop With Condition Inside

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Even:", num)
```

---

# 🔹 1️⃣4️⃣ Iterating Multiple Variables

```python
points = [(1,2), (3,4)]

for x, y in points:
    print(x, y)
```

Tuple unpacking.

---

# 🔹 1️⃣5️⃣ Loop Over File

```python
with open("file.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())
```

Efficient for large files.
