# 📌 PYTHON `reduce()` — COMPLETE REVISION SHEET

---

# 🧠 What is `reduce()`?

* Part of **`functools`** module
* Applies a **binary function** cumulatively to the items of an iterable
* Reduces iterable to a **single value**

---

# 🔹 1️⃣ Import

```python
from functools import reduce
```

---

# 🔹 2️⃣ Syntax

```python
reduce(function, iterable, initializer=None)
```

* `function` → takes **two arguments**
* `iterable` → list, tuple, etc.
* `initializer` → optional starting value
* Returns **single value**

---

# 🔹 3️⃣ Example — Sum of Numbers

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, nums)
print(total)  # 10
```

Internal steps:

```
Step1: 1 + 2 = 3
Step2: 3 + 3 = 6
Step3: 6 + 4 = 10
```

---

# 🔹 4️⃣ Example — Product of Numbers

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, nums)
print(product)  # 24
```

---

# 🔹 5️⃣ Example — Find Maximum

```python
nums = [5, 3, 8, 2]

max_val = reduce(lambda a, b: a if a > b else b, nums)
print(max_val)  # 8
```

---

# 🔹 6️⃣ Using Initializer

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]

total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, nums, 10)
# Starts with 10: 10+1=11, 11+2=13, 13+3=16
```

---

# 🔹 7️⃣ Lazy vs Immediate

* `reduce()` **computes immediately**
* Unlike `map()` or `filter()`, returns **single final result**

---

# 🔹 8️⃣ Reduce vs Loop

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Using reduce
total = reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, nums)

# Using loop
total = 0
for n in nums:
    total += n
```

* Functional style (reduce) → concise
* Loop → more readable for beginners

---

# 🧠 INTERNAL WORKING

1. Takes first two elements → applies function
2. Takes result + next element → applies function
3. Continues until end of iterable
4. Returns final value

With initializer, starts with it as first element.

---

# 🎯 Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting `from functools import reduce`
❌ Passing function that doesn’t accept **two arguments**
❌ Forgetting initializer when needed
❌ Using reduce for complex multi-step logic (hard to read)

# 🔥 Interview Questions (`reduce()`)

1. What is `reduce()`?
2. How is it different from `map()` and `filter()`?
3. Why do we need `functools`?
4. Explain initializer in `reduce()`.
5. Can we find max/min using reduce?
6. When is `reduce()` preferred over loops?
7. What is the accumulator concept?

---

If you want, I can **combine `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` into a single “Functional Programming Cheat Sheet”** with examples and interview questions — very handy for Day 2 revision.

Do you want me to do that next?
