Here’s your **PRINTABLE `zip()` CHEAT SHEET** — compact, structured, interview-ready.

---

# 📌 PYTHON `zip()` — COMPLETE REVISION SHEET

---

# 🧠 What is `zip()`?

* Combines **two or more iterables** element-wise
* Returns a **zip object** (lazy iterator)
* Stops at the **shortest iterable**

---

# 🔹 1️⃣ Syntax

```python
zip(iterable1, iterable2, ...)
```

* Can take **any number of iterables**
* Returns `zip` object → convert to `list`, `tuple`, `dict`

---

# 🔹 2️⃣ Basic Example

```python
names = ["Emon", "Alex", "John"]
ages = [22, 19, 25]

zipped = zip(names, ages)
print(list(zipped))
# [('Emon', 22), ('Alex', 19), ('John', 25)]
```

---

# 🔹 3️⃣ Shortest Iterable Behavior

```python
names = ["Emon", "Alex", "John"]
ages = [22, 19]

print(list(zip(names, ages)))
# [('Emon', 22), ('Alex', 19)]
```

* Stops when shortest iterable ends

---

# 🔹 4️⃣ Unzipping

Use `*` operator:

```python
pairs = [('Emon', 22), ('Alex', 19)]
names, ages = zip(*pairs)

print(names)  # ('Emon', 'Alex')
print(ages)   # (22, 19)
```

---

# 🔹 5️⃣ Converting to Dictionary

```python
names = ["Emon", "Alex"]
ages = [22, 19]

d = dict(zip(names, ages))
print(d)
# {'Emon': 22, 'Alex': 19}
```

---

# 🔹 6️⃣ Multiple Iterables

```python
a = [1, 2]
b = [3, 4]
c = [5, 6]

result = list(zip(a, b, c))
# [(1, 3, 5), (2, 4, 6)]
```

---

# 🔹 7️⃣ Use Cases

✅ Pairing data (keys + values)
✅ Iterating multiple sequences together
✅ Creating dictionaries
✅ Unpacking data

---

# 🧠 INTERNAL WORKING

1. Takes iterables
2. Creates **lazy iterator**
3. Generates tuples element-wise
4. Stops at shortest iterable

```python
z = zip([1,2,3], [4,5])
next(z)  # (1,4)
```

---

# 🎯 Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting to convert zip object to list/tuple
❌ Assuming it extends to longest iterable
❌ Not using `*` for unzipping

---

# 🔥 Interview Questions (`zip()`)

1. What is `zip()`?
2. How does zip behave with iterables of different lengths?
3. How to unzip a zipped object?
4. How to convert zipped pairs into a dictionary?
5. Can zip take more than two iterables?
6. What type does `zip()` return?
7. When is zip useful in data manipulation?

If you want, I can continue **`enumerate()` cheat sheet next**, so your **Day 2 Functional / Iteration Tools** section is fully ready.

Do you want me to do that?
