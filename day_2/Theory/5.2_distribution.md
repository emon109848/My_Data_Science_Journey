Here’s a **practical cheat sheet for Probability Distributions in NumPy**, focused on **common distributions, sampling, and use cases**.

# 📌 NUMPY PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS — CHEAT SHEET

---

## 1️⃣ Uniform Distribution

* **Definition:** Every value in range `[low, high)` is **equally likely**
* **NumPy Syntax:**

```python
import numpy as np

# 5 samples between 0 and 1
samples = np.random.uniform(0, 1, 5)
print(samples)
```

* **Use Cases:**

  * Simulations where all outcomes are equally likely
  * Random initialization in ML (e.g., weights)

---

## 2️⃣ Normal (Gaussian) Distribution

* **Definition:** Bell-shaped, defined by **mean (`μ`)** and **std (`σ`)**
* **NumPy Syntax:**

```python
samples = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=5)  # mean=0, std=1
```

* **Use Cases:**

  * Modeling natural phenomena (heights, errors, noise)
  * Initialization of neural network weights
  * Statistical inference / z-scores

---

## 3️⃣ Binomial Distribution

* **Definition:** Number of successes in `n` trials with probability `p`
* **NumPy Syntax:**

```python
samples = np.random.binomial(n=10, p=0.5, size=5)
print(samples)  # # successes in 10 trials
```

* **Use Cases:**

  * Coin toss simulations
  * Predicting yes/no outcomes
  * Risk analysis in finance

---

## 4️⃣ Law of Large Numbers (LLN)

* **Idea:** Average of random samples **approaches expected value** as sample size increases

```python
samples = np.random.normal(0,1,100000)
mean = np.mean(samples)  # ≈ 0
```

* **Use Cases:**

  * Monte Carlo simulations
  * Estimating probabilities
  * Experimental validation

---

## 5️⃣ Random Experiments / Simulation

* **Coin Toss:**

```python
coin = np.random.choice(['H', 'T'], size=10)
```

* **Dice Roll:**

```python
dice = np.random.randint(1,7,size=10)
```

* **Use Cases:**

  * Simulate events for statistics or games
  * Test algorithms under random inputs
  * Generate synthetic datasets

---

## 6️⃣ Quick Tips

* Use **`np.random.seed()`** for reproducibility
* Uniform → equal probability, Normal → bell curve, Binomial → discrete success counts
* Always check **sample size** for reliable estimates
